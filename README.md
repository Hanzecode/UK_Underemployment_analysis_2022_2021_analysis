This project is used to analyse elements that affect the underemployement in the UK, and this is a part of my data analysis job at Quilombo UK

First: I extract the columns needed through 2022 and 2021 calandars, understanding society made by the uk househould longtitudial study

Second: Use the main_data_edit.ipynb and sub_data_edit to merge the data of two years, sub_data is used to get immigration status

Third: All the analysis are available on analysis.ipynb file

Background Context
Underemployment refers to situations where individuals are in work, but their employment does not fully match their skills, qualifications, or desired working hours — or does not provide fair or adequate compensation for those skills. It represents a mismatch between potential and actual work use, typically reflecting involuntary rather than chosen circumstances.
There are main forms:
•	Skills underemployment (overqualification): when someone’s education level is higher than what their job requires (for example, a university graduate in a routine or service role).
•	Wage underemployment: The person’s hourly wage is lower than would be expected given their education or occupation level.
These may overlap into a combined/multiple underemployment — when two or more forms occur simultaneously, for instance, a graduate mother working part-time below her skill level may face both.
Underemployment is often invisible in labour statistics, yet it has major effects on mobility, income, and health. Many people remain in mismatched or unstable jobs for years, becoming trapped rather than progressing.
